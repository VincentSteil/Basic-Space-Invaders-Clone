Basic-Space-Invaders-Clone
==========================

A basic space invaders clone in C for the lm3s1968 evaluation board.

Mostly coded in one very, very long night after my partner decided not to deliver the code he promised leaving me to redesign it in a more limited scope from scratch at the last minute. 

Needless to say, it's more hacky and far less elegant than I would like. Maybe some day I'll find the time to refactor this.
